 
The dataset

Drug: Morphine

Q: Respiratory Rate plot
A:  Supposed to drop to zero from 1.6F, but the graph does not show so.
Bill: The model is wrong;
run the model with 100 (mg) morphine;
if oxygenate the person, he/she may come back;
 
Q: Pressure of respiratory rate
Observation:
It drops as is expected; the plot of morphine should look like this way
Around 270, the curve should go back to the normal level
 
Propofol:
Q: Arterial Pressure
A: Looks fine
 
Q: Heart Rate
A: At around 30 - 40, it is not supposed to go down; not supposed to rise again.
 
Q: respiratory Rate
A: Supposed to come up at some point and recover
 
Rocuronium
Q: Arterial Pressure
A: Not supposed to do anything on the patient (Fluctuation)
Go up, stay for a minute, then plummets to the bottom
 
Q: heart rate plot
A: It is supposed to be flat and then falls off cause the heart is dying
Supposed to be steeper, stay for a little bit, and then drops all the way
 
Q: respiratory rate
A: makes sense.
 
Q: oxygen saturation
A: makes sense
    How to evaluate: pick a small number
 
Succinlcholine
 
Q: Arterial Pressure
A: Look like the one of rocuronium
 
Q: respiratory rate
A: Should look like this (why there is a hiccup)
Supposed to come back up as long as the patient is alive (After 4 mins)

Try-out for Sean to run:
Drug: Fentanyl
If give 500 micrograms of fentanyl (10 ml of 50 mcg/ml)
To a normal healthy person, stop breathing in 30 secs

Put everything into one graph and scale them properly

Questions for BioGears:
Where do they get their models from?

Research paper: Measuring the Repeatability of Simulated Physiology in Simulators
Q: part2 shows equivalent training method, but how should we address it?
A: 2.1 people practice on human beings within the current paradigm of training
Often time, people cannot take care of actual humans well; in the old days, they used animals which caused a lot of problems; OVERALL IT IS BAD, CRUEL, MONEY-CONSUMING, UNETHICAL, BAD WAY TO TRAIN PEOPLE
Author:
Ziv: Ethical imperative of human simulation (Bill will mail this to us)
In the real world, we can try out things like 100g of morphine, which is impossible to do on actual humans.
 
Mannequin: The model also has its limits
 
Problems of SBS: inaccurate physiological engine; 
need an instructor to take care of everything;
Need to have an accurate physiological engine that handles everything; has multiple options that trainees could try.
 
We want to take the best model, CAE model, and then compare it to BioGears (open source, which we will use as the physiological engine for the simulator).
 
Q: 4 -5 drugs that we use; keep them SIMPLE
 
Q: On the paper, we will  populate a table with numbers, graphs
 
Send Bill the time to meet on Wednesday, February 24th
